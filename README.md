# Immutability and Mutability in JavaScript

## Tasks

The tasks are in the `1_task` and `3_task` folders.

Please do not execute functions in the `task*.js` files,
because the same file is used for testing and we
do not want to call anything, when the module is loaded.

Use the `playground.js` to import and try out the files
if necessary.

You can run all tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

Run tests only for task1 or task3:

```sh
npm test -- task1
npm test -- task3
```
